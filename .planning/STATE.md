# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-12)

**Core value:** When `claude` is running in the integrated terminal, Discord shows you as "cooking" — not "Idling" — with goblin-voice copy that feels personal, not corporate.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — skeleton-rpc-seam

## Current Position

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Phase 1: Discord Developer Portal app creation + OpenVSX namespace claim flagged as `[HUMAN]` prerequisites with variable lead time — must start in Phase 1, not Phase 6
- Phase 1: CI bundle-size guardrail (SKEL-04) must be online before any later phase can over-commit
- Phase 5: Three sub-deliverables (companion plugin / OSS hygiene / assets + README) run concurrently via `parallelization: true`

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- OpenVSX namespace claim has variable lead time; if approval hasn't cleared by Phase 6, release workflow should `continue-on-error` on OpenVSX publish and Marketplace ships standalone
- Cursor-on-Windows fs-watch fallback has no existing verifier evidence — real Windows testing required during Phase 5 for README troubleshooting section
